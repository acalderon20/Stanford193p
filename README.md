# 🃏 Stanford CS193p Card Game Project

Welcome to my implementation of the **Card-Matching Game**, inspired by Stanford's renowned **CS193p iOS Development** course (2023 edition). This project reflects the culmination of lessons from **Lectures 1–6**, showcasing best practices in modern iOS development with **SwiftUI** and **MVVM architecture**. 🎉

## 🛠️ Key Skills & Concepts

This project demonstrates my expertise in the following:

### **🚀 SwiftUI**
- Declarative UI creation for clean and maintainable code.
- Advanced layout management using `ZStack`, `HStack`, and `LazyVGrid`.

### **📐 MVVM Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns into **Model**, **View**, and **ViewModel** layers.
- Efficient state management using `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@ObservedObject`.

### **🧩 Protocol-Oriented Programming**
- Modular and reusable code with protocols and generics.
- Adherence to single-responsibility principles for scalable solutions.

### **🧮 Functional Programming**
- Immutability and pure functions for clean data handling.
- Utilization of Swift’s `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions for logic simplification.

### **🎞️ Animation**
- Interactive user experiences with SwiftUI’s built-in animation tools.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Objective**: Match pairs of cards by tapping them to reveal their contents.  
2. **Themes**: Enjoy different card symbols and colors with thematic customization.  
3. **Scoring**: Gain points for correct matches; lose points for mismatches.  
4. **Shuffle & Reset**: Refresh the game with the shuffle or new game options.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: For declarative UI and dynamic interfaces.  
- **Combine Framework**: For state and data flow management.  
- **Xcode 15**: For development, testing, and debugging.
